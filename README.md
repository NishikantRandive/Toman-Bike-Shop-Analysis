# Toman-Bike-Shop-Analysis
Toman Bike Share seeks the creation of a dashboard to visualize key performance metrics. This includes hourly revenue analysis, profit and revenue trends, seasonal revenue, and rider demographics to facilitate informed decision-making.

The dashboard should adhere to the company's color scheme and ensure ease of navigation. The necessary data will be provided through access to the company's databases, or alternatively, a new database should be created.

A preliminary version of the dashboard is required as soon as possible. Additionally, an estimated timeline for completion and recommendations regarding potential price adjustments for the next year are requested.
